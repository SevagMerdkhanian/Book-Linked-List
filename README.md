A linked list where the data type is a Book Object. This project was an assignment for Object Oriented Programming II, done with a teammate. 
The program reads from a file called Books.txt, processes the records and adds them to a Linked List. The program then allows a user to do 
various things with the linked list, such as adding Books.
